    "## Abstract\n",
    "We find the optimal path and control for navigating from one planet to another within a solar system. We derive state equations using using the laws of gravity, an acceleration control, and Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. We modeled both the fixed and free final and initial time cases. We solved for several viable trajectories, finding the trajectories resulting from optimizing over both free initial and final times to typically yield the best results."

    "Since planetary orbits are essentially planar, we simplified the problem by only working in two dimensions. The only elements that affect the ship's motion are the forces of gravity between it and the planets in the system, and its own acceleration control. Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation states that the force of gravity applied on body $2$, exerted by body $1$, is given as follows, where $G$ is the universal gravitational constant.\n",

    "\n",
    "We used this equation and Newton's second law of motion, $F=ma$, to solve for the acceleration of the ship due to the gravity applied by a given planet. The net acceleration is given by the sum of the accelerations from all planets in the system, combined with the acceleration due to the ship's control. This defines the state equations, where $m_p$ is the mass of the planet, $\\mathbf{x}_p$ is the position vector of the planet, $\\mathbf{x}_s$ is the position vector of the spaceship, and $\\mathbf{u}$ is the acceleration control vector of the spaceship. The set of all $n$ planets in the system is given as $P = \\{p_1, p_2,\\dots,p_n\\}$ where $p_1$ is the planet Caladan, and $p_2$ is the planet Arrakis. The planets are modeled as point masses, with position and velocity functions defined separately according to their known elliptical orbits, assuming the force of gravity from the ship on the planet is negligible.\n",

    "This section details some successful results (see below), as well as some shortcomings (further below). Finally, we include a try-it-yourself section! The animations are most illustrative of the results. These display the fixed time solution for a given $t_0$ and $t_f$ on the right, as well as the free time solution using the same $t_0$ and $t_f$ on the right. The title displays the provided $t_0$ and $t_f$, as well as the optimal $t_0$ and $t_f$ calculated for the free-time scenario. Furthermore, they display the value of the cost functional $J$ for the calculated trajectory. The upper plots in the animation show the trajectory over time along with the evolution of the planetary orbits. The lower plots show the optimal controls for each direction, corresponding to the left y-axis, along with the magnitude of the rocket's velocity, corresponding to the right y-axis.\n",

    "### Successful Trajectories\n",
    "We solved for the optimal trajectories and controls for various fixed initial and final times, as well as free initial and final times with various initial guesses. We found that the free time case was relatively sensitive to initial guess. Rather than finding a globally optimal launch and landing time, it found a more optimal time in a small window around the initial guess. Importantly, the maximal velocities were generally similar to those of objects launched by humanity, such as the Voyager 1 [CITATION]"

    "Our model does have some limitations. Firstly, there is still some instability, especially when we include the Sun. Perplexingly, the fixed-time case sometimes functions properly when the sun is present, but the free-time case fails to converge to reasonable trajectories or optimal times. Secondly, the solver is very sensitive to initial state guesses. The state guess we chose by done by trial and error, and we realized that when our state guesses are too small, the model becomes unstable. Refer to the animations below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides computational limitations, our model has a few fundamental limitations due to its scope. We modeled with acceleration directly as a control, while using thrust as a control, then calculating acceleration based on thrust, would be more accurate. This could be even further developed to allow for a decreasing mass as fuel is expelled in order to accelerate. We also chose to model a ship that can accelerate in any direction at any time. Though this seems accurate to the ships the Spacing Guild flies, rockets on Earth can only exert thrust out the back while making small corrections in its orientation. While in space they can easily make large changes to their orientation, during takeoff and landing, this is especially a concern. The specifics of takeoff and landing were beyond our scope, but are further complicated due to planetary rotation, air resistance, and other factors. As our scope involved general trajectory planning and optimization over generally known timeframes, our model is still incredibly useful in accomplishing this goal."

    "* Maybe slightly flesh this out a bit more\n",
    "We successfully derived state and costate equations that accurately modeled the dynamics of a spaceship traveling through a solar system while trying to minimize fuel consumption with free time boundaries. We used these equations to set up and numerically solve for a boundary value problem, finding several viable trajectories for the spacing guild's mission. We optimized the code for numerical stability, but the solver is still sensitive to initial guesses when solving for free initial or final times, and sometimes the free-time solver picks wildly different times. In the scenarios we simulated we would recommend success #2 because it expends less fuel and get from Caladan to Arrakis within a reasonable time frame."
