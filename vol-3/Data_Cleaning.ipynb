    "* The normal Kalman filter may not be the ideal tool for this situation, as angles are distributed along a circle [0,2Ï€] instead of the whole real line like the normal distribution and in turn the Kalman filter assumes. We need to investigate how to deal with doing arithmetic around the circle, as well as exploring adjusting the Kalman filter to work with \"circular\" normal distributions instead of the standard normal\\\n",

    "* We also want to investigate if there's a robust way to predict whether or not there is a source present in order to know whether we should perform prediction + update or only preform prediction at a given update\\\n",
    "* We need to investigate using a state evolution based on angular velocity, and how it performs against estimating the state evolution equations with methods discussed in class.\\\n",
    "* We might also need to use a particle filter or unscented Kalman filter instead of the standard filter. We will explore alternative algorithms for use in the project.\\"
